Hello everyone who decides to read this description, to start I want to inform
everyone that this is my first time working with GitHub and and trying to get really
familiar with it. 
-Today I learned how to make a repository, and how to create a new branch out of my
master branch.
-Also I learned to edit a file.
Just playing around github
